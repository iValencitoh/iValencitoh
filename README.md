I am an Argentine student (16 years old) who likes logic, computers, and cats (a lot).  

ğŸ“š Currently, I am studying my last year in high school and continuing with the beginning of my university studies at the **University of Buenos Aires (UBA)** in the computer science career.  

With that said, if you have any kind of query, don't hesitate to contact me on any of my social networks. ğŸ˜„
